As a full stack web developer, its the devopers responability to request the information from an API and the method used is usually fetch.

# Assignment 
This assignment seemed to be the most difficult to date. I have been working hard to learn all the new material since I have never coded anything, ever before. All my hard work had caught up with me and it was as if I had forgot everything I learned to date. I guess the fatigue had set in and I couldnt learn anything new and forgot everything. I was pushing to learn everything because the project was coming up and had others to help as well. This didnt happen. Luckily I was able to get my part done for the assignment and help others out in the many zoom meetings we had. I guess I was just expecting to much, that I should somehow be able to do it all by now. That I could make the website and pull the API'S all by myself. I mean I am close and really have a good grasp on the harder stuff in the back end. However, the easy stuff does not come easily to me like it should. I still have a hard time with moving stuff on the site andusing div's properly. How is that possible, that stuff is the easiest part. I get it when someone shows it to me and when I use the div tool that shows each div on the site and where its located on the html.However to creat it from scratch for myself I get lost. I try and follow the bootstrap method, container, row, column. The first one works out, but somehow the rest of the div sections dont want to follow suit. 

The fatigue of teaching this to myself and not really taking any breaks from it and stresses of everyday life cause up with me this week. So, I see why we have 2 weeks to do the assignment.One week to try and get the work done and the next to try and relax and finish up the work. I do appreciate my group and and it helped with the load of the project. Our group worked well together and their was a nice blend of strengths and weaknessess. Where one lacked the other picked up the slack. 
This brings us to my next hurdle of this project. On the friday before the assignment was due, I was just about done and was doing the finishing touches to the assignment, when the API  decided to throw me a 401 bad fetch code. I looked up the error code and it said that I was in error with my request. I checked over the request and there were no errors in the html and I know I had not made any changes to the html. So I looked into the error code further and found it could be a authentication problem. So, I decided to create a new account on the open weather API and see if I needed a new key cause I had maxed out my requests. This changed nothing, I was still getting error code. So, I looked into the weather API a little further and found that neither account was allowing access to the API
